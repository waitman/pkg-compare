Usage: pkg-compare [options] new_path old_path

This program reads local.sqlite in new_path and compares list of installed
packages in local.sqlite in old_path. If a package is found in old_path which
is not in new_path then the name of the port is printed, one per line.

Command line switches:
        -p      prefix uninstalled packages with 'pkg install'

Upgrade Strategy:

# mv /usr/local /usr/old-local
# mv /var/db/pkg /var/db/old-pkg
# cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg
# make
# make install clean
# pkg-compare -p /var/db/pkg /var/db/old-pkg > upgrade.sh
# sh upgrade.sh
